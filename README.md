My wife posed me the following question:  In a game of bingo with n cards in play, what is the average length of a game?  I attempted to answer this question in two ways.

1. Build a bingo simulator which takes as input the number of cards in play, the number of trials to run, and how often to print results, 
generates random bingo boards and runs random bingo games, and prints out the average length of game from that data.

2. Assume every board is in play and write a program to compute the average length of game in this scenario.

According to the law of large numbers, these two methods should agree in the limit as the number of boards increases.
